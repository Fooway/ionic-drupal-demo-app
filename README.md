Ionic Framework Sample App
==========================

This application is a very simple demo of how easy it is to get a mobile app backed by Drupal up and running.

This is the front end of the application.  It uses the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), which brings in turn leverages [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

To get started with this application, clone the project down.  Make sure you have Ionic [installed on your local machine](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/installation.html).  Then run one of the following commands:

```
ionic serve # Opens a browser to the application and live-reloads as you work.
ionic emulate # Opens an emulator for iOS/Android depending on your project settings.
```
